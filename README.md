# pennyPaperclips
Penny Paperclips is a web based inventory application running on Dot Net Nuke. The MIT license applies only to the portions of the application written by me. The Licenses folder contains additional license information. Products shown in the application are not real, and included for demonstration purposes only. Some of the DNN javascript relating to styles has been modified. Custom modules I have created can be found by navigating to DesktopModules->PennyPaperClips. I have also included the Inventory Tracking SQL database files in the App_Data folder. You will need a little knowledge of Dot Net Nuke and SQL Server to set up this application on your machine. Please email me for user names and passwords if needed.
